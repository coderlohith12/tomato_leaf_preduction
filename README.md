In India about 58% of the populace relies on agriculture till 2021
Identification of the plant diseases is important in order to prevent the losses within the yield
It's terribly troublesome to observe the plant diseases manually
CNN models can be employed for the detection of plant diseases. In this project, we have described the technique for the detection of plant diseases with help of their leaf's pictures
CNN is a part of Deep learning a class of  neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual features
Transfer learning speeds up the learning process and reduces the training time, and thus decreases PoC and project delivery time
Crop diseases are a key danger for food security, but their speedy identification is still difficult in many portions of the world because of the lack of the essential infrastructure. Using a public dataset of 10000+ images of infected and healthy leaves collected under controlled conditions, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify diseases
Work focuses on classification and identification of plant leaf diseases using convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques. We consider four CNN architectures, namely VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet, and Inception v3.

Existing System
Most of the Farmers use the manual support to detect and identify the Disease
The Existing  model  uses the Deep Learning Techniques like DenseNet, Mask r CNN,ResNet 152
These are having 2 major issues in their projects like OverFitting
Many  Existing  models  have  used  with  CNN  but  not  with  the Transfer  Learning Techniques

Proposed System
This Detection Model takes images as input data
Train the Model with the Data set and Test the Model
We Use Transfer Learning to Train the model 
By Using Transfer Learning we can achieve the 2 major problems with the previous projects
